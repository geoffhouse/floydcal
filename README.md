Floydcal is a handy tool that takes your SHFGS timetable HTML file and turns it into a calendar file you can use anywhere. This means you can easily add your school schedule to apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, or Apple Calendar without having to type in every single lesson.

I originally built this for myself because I was tired of manually adding my lessons to my family's Google Calendar each term. If you find it useful for your own schedule, I'm glad it can help!

Floydcal was built with React.js and Next.js and is hosted on Vercel. You can view all of the code on GitHub.
